# FR-Calc

A simple calculator for online browser-based game FlightRising. Users looking for a changelog and feature to-do list should check my thread in the Guides forum. 


## Current Features

### Show-Only Dropdown
![filter-feature](https://i.imgur.com/FqINtPM.png)  
Right below the calc/clear buttons you'll see a 'show only' dropdown menu now. You can sort between All genes, Modern, Ancient, Gaoler-only, or Banescale-only. Which should make calculating a breeze if you're only after a specific set of genes! 
Switching between these views [b]will clear quantities and calc totals[/b]. In the future I may look to implement a 'save values' button so you can switch between while preserving your quantity tallies.

### Sort-By Dropdown

You can now sort by several options: Price (low to high), Price (high to low), or Alphabetically. 
Switching between these sort options [b]will clear quantities and calc totals[/b]. I am currently debating which would be better or whether to implement a toggle!

### Selection Highlighting
Now when you click on a gene input to add quantity, the box will highlight green to show you exactly which one you clicked on

### Automatic Copy-to-Clipboard
Clicking on the 'total' after calculating will now automatically copy your price total to your clipboard. Added a small 'copied!' popup to show that.
