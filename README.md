# FR-Calc

A simple calculator for online browser-based game FlightRising. Users looking for a changelog and feature to-do list should check my thread in the Guides forum. 


## Current Features

### Show-Only Dropdown

Right below the calc/clear buttons you'll see a 'show only' dropdown menu now. You can sort between All genes, Modern, Ancient, Gaoler-only, or Banescale-only. Which should make calculating a breeze if you're only after a specific set of genes! 
Switching between these views [b]will clear quantities and calc totals[/b]. In the future I may look to implement a 'save values' button so you can switch between while preserving your quantity tallies.

### Sort-By Dropdown

You can now sort by several options: Price (low to high), Price (high to low), or Alphabetically. 
Switching between these sort options [b]will clear quantities and calc totals[/b]. I am currently debating which would be better or whether to implement a toggle!
