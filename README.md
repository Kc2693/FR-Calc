# FR-Calc

A simple calculator for online browser-based game FlightRising. Users looking for a changelog and feature to-do list should check my thread in the Guides forum. 


## Current Features

### Show-Only Dropdown
![filter-feature](https://i.imgur.com/FqINtPM.png)  
Right below the calc/clear buttons you'll see a 'show only' dropdown menu now. You can sort between All genes, Modern, Ancient, Gaoler-only/Banescale-only/Veilspun-only. Which should make calculating a breeze if you're only after a specific set of genes!  
Switching between these views will clear quantities and calc totals. Want a toggle? Let me know.

### Sort-By Dropdown
![sort-feature](https://i.postimg.cc/nzCffpVL/344324.png)  
You can now sort by several options: Price (low to high), Price (high to low), or Alphabetically.   
Switching between these sort options will clear quantities and calc totals. Want a toggle? Let me know. 

### Selection Highlighting
Now when you click on a gene input to add quantity, the box will highlight green to show you exactly which one you clicked on.

### Automatic Copy-to-Clipboard
Clicking on the 'total' after calculating will now automatically copy your price total to your clipboard. Added a small 'copied!' popup to show that.
